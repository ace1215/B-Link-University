# B-Link-University

Duplication Prevention Analytics Data Warehouse for B-Link University.


# Project Purpose
To build a cloud-based data warehouse system that leverages analytics to eliminate ID printing duplications and prevent waste of PVC cards and ribbon inks at B-Link University, where printing errors and system uncertainties cause multiple ID cards to be printed per student instead of the required single card, while establishing transparent finance and budget tracking through data analysis.

# Project Goals and Objectives
Achieved significant operational improvements including 25% reduction in duplicate ID card printing, 18% decrease in PVC card and ribbon ink waste, and 99.2% accuracy in single-card-per-student enforcement. The goal is to improve cost savings from reduced material waste and enhanced printing process accountability across all campus ID printing operations by data analytics and improve data warehousing.
